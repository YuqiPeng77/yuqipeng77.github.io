Hi, I’m Yuqi Peng (彭瑀琦). I am an M.S. student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and I expect to complete my degree in April 2026. Before coming to Northeastern, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Colorado Denver.

I worked as a Research Assistant at MMLab, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology in 2025, supervised by Prof. Shifeng Chen and Prof. Jianzhuang Liu. 

Outside of my studies, I enjoy playing badminton and am a member of the Northeastern University badminton team.

I plan to apply for PhD programs starting in Fall 2026, as I hope to continue exploring ideas at the intersection of vision, language, and learning.
